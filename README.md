**Running lambda function in python for get_item &amp; scan operation of DynamoDB**

Create a Table named "Demo" and creata a Lambda function with runtime as Python. Add the DynamoDB IAM permission JS file as an incline policy for the IAM roles. 
Demo table has three columns in my case: Name(S), LastName(S), Location(S).
